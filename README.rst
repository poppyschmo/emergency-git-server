====================
Emergency Git Server
====================

A minimal, "single-serving" Git HTTP server for

1. Emergencies
2. Local, ad hoc experimentation
3. Git education

Normal, everyday use is not recommended unless security and performance are
non-issues. Requires a normal Git installation. There's really no need to
``git clone`` or ``pip install`` since this thing is a single file. See
``--help`` for available options.

*Update 2019*
    This project has been retired. PM if you want the PyPI name.


Example
-------

Use case
    Some VM or container in which SSH/NFS/SMB aren't desired and for which
    folder sharing or volume mapping aren't worth configuring

On the host
    .. code:: console

        laptop:~$ curl -L "$github_raw_url" | python3 - ./www
        Serving over port 8000 ...

On the client
    .. code:: console

        [my_vm]# git clone http://laptop.local:8000/repos/my_repo.git
        Cloning ...

Some caveats
    1. Your network setup might require that you provide an IP address
       (perhaps of a bridge) in place of ``localhost`` or ``laptop.local``.
       Export that (or ``0.0.0.0``) as ``_HOST`` to the server's environment.

    2. The target repo on the server *must* be named ``*.git``.  If it's
       beneath a working directory and you don't want a leaf named ``.git``,
       use a symlink::

            ~/
            └── www/
                └── repos/
                    ├── my_repo.git -> ./my_repo/.git
                    └── my_repo/
                        ├── ...
                        └── .git/

    3. Non-bare repos must have the ``receive.denyCurrentBranch`` option set to
       ``updateInstead`` in order to receive pushes and update the working
       directory. (The same applies to any transport when the pushed branch is
       checked out on the receiving end.)

       .. code:: console

            laptop:my_repo$ git config --add receive.denyCurrentBranch "updateInstead"
